# My-RayTracer

This is a simple ray-tracer based on my homework of "Computer Graphics  CSE167x" online course of Edx.
I used glm(OpenGL Mathematics) and FreeImage in my project when I finished my course.
This is for learning computer graphics and github.


the main features of this project:

basic 3D-Transform

support geometry: sphere triangle

bling-phong Lighting model diffuse specular shadow

Recursive reflection
